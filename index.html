        <h2>Introduction to Optical Illusions</h2>
        <p>Optical illusions are fascinating visual phenomena that trick our brains into perceiving <br> something that isn't entirely true. They highlight the complex interplay between <br> our eyes and our brains in interpreting the world around us.</p>

                The Shepard tone of sound example EverRise contains many octaves of the same note (indicated as C). <br> Successive tones increase in frequency with amplitudes that increase (for low frequencies) <br> and decrease (for high frequencies). The dotted lines indicate the C# tone. As the highest frequencies dissolve into inaudibility, <br> the lowest frequencies become perceptible.
